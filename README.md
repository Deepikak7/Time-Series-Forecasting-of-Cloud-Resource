ABSTRACT
In the recent cloud computing research field, the allocation of virtual resources has become a major concern.The Virtual Machine (VM) dynamic deployment technique isone of the key virtual resource management techniques.Virtual resource management predicts the resources on the virtual machine and manages accordingly. The study of the Virtual Machine resource dynamic deployment focuses on the fine-grained resource adjustment strategy. So there is a need for predicting the usage of resources for the virtual machine to avoid delays, overprovisioning and underprovisioning.Time series forecasting models are used because predictions of cloud resources are dependent on time. In this paper, we have fitted different time series models and ensemble techniques to predict the resource usage for the successive hours. We have implemented various time series analysistechniques to study the dataset and to choose the appropriate model. Various types of resources such as cpu usage, disk read times, disk write times and memory usage are predicted using the above models.
